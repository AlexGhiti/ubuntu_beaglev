# Ubuntu install

First, we will flash the necessary firmwares in the SPI flash: `ddrinit` and `u-boot SPL`. Those two firmwares likely won't require any updates as their only job is to pass control to `u-boot/openSBI` that are resident on the sdcard and that will certainly require fixes and updates. In the Ubuntu image, we decided to have them on the sdcard so that they can be updated automatically when upgrading the `u-boot-starfive` ([An initial version can be found in my PPA](https://launchpad.net/~alexghiti/+archive/ubuntu/riscv/+files/u-boot-starfive_2021.10-starlight-ge77cc7b-0ubuntu1-ppa0_riscv64.deb)) package, so that you won't have to plug your FTDI in again.

To update the SPI flash firmwares, prepare the FTDI following [the instructions](https://bootlin.com/blog/buildroot-beagle-v/) section "Preparing the board".

## 1. Install `JH7100_ddrinit` firmware:

You can either download a [pre-built version](https://github.com/AlexGhiti/JH7100_ddrinit/releases/tag/ubuntu_beaglev_v1) or build it using the following instructions:

### Build

Download an [elf toolchain from SiFive](https://github.com/sifive/freedom-tools/releases) and then:


	$ git clone https://github.com/AlexGhiti/JH7100_ddrinit --branch=int/alex/spl
	$ cd JH7100_ddrinit/build
	$ PATH=$TOOLCHAIN_PATH/bin/:$PATH make


### Flash

To flash this new firmware, at the BeagleV boot, press any key before the 2 seconds countdown ends.
The following menu will appear:


	***************************************************
	*************** FLASH PROGRAMMING *****************
	***************************************************

	0:update uboot
	1:quit
	select the function:


enter `root@s5t` and the following menu will appear:


	0:update second boot
	1:update ddr init boot
	2:update uboot
	3:quit
	select the function:


Select `update ddr init boot` and use minicom xsend functionality to send the file named `ddrinit-2133-XXXXXX.bin.out` that you have just downloaded or which is in the `build` directory if you built it yourself.


## 2. u-boot SPL flash

You can either download a [pre-built version](https://github.com/AlexGhiti/u-boot/releases/tag/ubuntu_beaglev_v1) or build it using the following instructions:

### Build


	$ git clone https://github.com/AlexGhiti/u-boot --branch=int/alex/spl_support
	$ cd u-boot
	$ make starfive_jh7100_starlight_smode_defconfig
	$ make -j8 CROSS_COMPILE=riscv64-linux-gnu-


We don't need openSBI binary for SPL so you can ignore the following warning:


	Image 'main-section' is missing external blobs and is non-functional: opensbi

	Some images are invalid


### Flash

Reboot the board and enter the flash programming menu:


	***************************************************
	*************** FLASH PROGRAMMING *****************
	***************************************************

	0:update uboot
	1:quit
	select the function:


Select `update uboot` and use minicom xsend functionality to send the file named `u-boot-spl-dtb.bin.out`.

## 3. Flash the Ubuntu image on the sdcard

Download the [Ubuntu image](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fQsCzH1mVLc4c2cU4hgai2PlnNMpLpbD/view?usp=sharing) and flash it on your sdcard using:


	$ dd if=ubuntu_beaglev.img of=/dev/YOUR_SDCARD_BLOCK_DEVICE


Insert the sdcard and then enjoy using Ubuntu on the BeagleV :)
